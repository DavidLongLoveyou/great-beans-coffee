# The Vietnamese Arabica Revolution: How Highland Terroirs Are Reshaping Specialty Coffee

For decades, Vietnam has been synonymous with Robusta coffee production, ranking as the world's second-largest coffee producer. However, a quiet revolution has been brewing in the country's highland regions, where exceptional Arabica coffee is challenging traditional sourcing paradigms and capturing the attention of specialty coffee roasters worldwide.

## The Emergence of Vietnamese Highland Arabica

### Historical Context

Vietnam's Arabica story began during the French colonial period in the 1920s, when French planters recognized the potential of the country's highland regions for Arabica cultivation. However, political upheaval and economic priorities shifted focus to Robusta production for several decades.

**Key Historical Milestones:**
- **1920s**: French planters establish first Arabica plantations in Da Lat and Cau Dat
- **1930s-1980s**: Focus shifts to Robusta for economic stability
- **1990s**: Renewed interest in Arabica quality and specialty markets
- **2000s**: International recognition and specialty coffee certifications
- **2010s**: Emergence as serious specialty coffee origin
- **2020s**: Global recognition and premium market positioning

### Current Production Landscape

Today, Vietnam produces approximately 25,000-30,000 tons of Arabica annually, representing about 15% of the country's total coffee production. While this may seem modest compared to Robusta volumes, the quality and potential of Vietnamese Arabica have captured international attention.

**Regional Distribution:**
- **Lam Dong Province**: 60% of Arabica production (Da Lat, Cau Dat regions)
- **Kon Tum Province**: 20% of production (experimental and heritage farms)
